# Documentation and sources

The code from this project was based on some documentation which can be found at the links below. Further implementations are needed for a more consistent `asynchronous` behavior.

## Docs:

1. [Duration cast](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/chrono/duration_cast/) - learn how to convert from numbers into time for setting threads to do work
2. [Duration](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/duration/duration_cast) -   Converting integral duration to integral duration of shorter divisible time unit. No `duration_cast` needed
3. [Constructor overloading](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/constructors) - implements constructor overloading with different number of parameters
4. [`std::packaged_task`](https://thispointer.com/c11-multithreading-part-10-packaged_task-example-and-tutorial/) - C++11 Multithreading
5. [`std::future`](https://thispointer.com/c11-multithreading-part-8-stdfuture-stdpromise-and-returning-values-from-thread/) - Working with the future implementation: **C++11 Multithreading â€“ std::future , std::promise and Returning values from Thread**
6. [`sleep_for()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/sleep_for) - operating with threads
